# Raghuvansh Rastogi

**DeFi Protocol Engineer · AI Infrastructure · Systems Architect**

I design and ship financial infrastructure — smart contracts that hold real capital, AI systems that serve production traffic, and backend architecture built for scale. My work sits at the intersection of programmable money and intelligent systems.

### What I Build

**DeFi Protocols** — Collateralized stability mechanisms, oracle-integrated pricing systems, gas-optimized token distribution via Merkle proofs. Solidity, Foundry, Hardhat. Contracts deployed and holding value on mainnet.

**AI Infrastructure** — Multi-model routing and inference platforms with 99.99% uptime targets. Production APIs serving real workloads with monitoring, failover, and cost optimization baked in.

**Network & Backend Systems** — Distributed monitoring, asset discovery, and event-driven architectures. Java/Spring Boot, Python, PostgreSQL, Docker. Contributor to open-source tooling with thousands of GitHub stars.

### Technical Stack

`Solidity` · `Java` · `Python` · `JavaScript` · `Foundry` · `Hardhat` · `Spring Boot` · `Docker` · `PostgreSQL` · `Ethereum` · `Chainlink` · `Web3.js`

### Currently Focused On

Identifying structural inefficiencies in high-throughput financial systems — where capital moves at scale but the underlying infrastructure hasn't caught up. Building the protocols and tooling to close those gaps.
